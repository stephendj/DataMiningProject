If that was really what the FBI said, I'm extrelemy suspicious: They
_knew_ the Branch Davidian was a very paranoid group. To say, "...or
you will be gassed" would probably have been understood as _poison_
gas, not tear gas. If the FBI made that remark, I'd say they were
encouraging an extreme reaction.
