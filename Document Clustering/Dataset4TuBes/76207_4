Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance! With every
Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral
bankruptcy of Israel's occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli
government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life.


	Apparently, the Hizbollah were encouraged by Brad's cheers
	(good job, Brad). Someone forgot to tell them, though, that 
	Brad asks them to place only Israeli _sons_ in the grave, 
	not daughters. Paraphrasing a bit, with every rocket that 
	the Hizbollah fires on the Galilee, they justify Israel's 
	holding to the security zone. 

Noam
