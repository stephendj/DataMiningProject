Are we supposed to thank you for your generosity?  
Or should we be pleased with your minimal common sense?

Why is it that when someone writes something simple like "All Jews
sufffered during WWII" that YOU feel the burning need to add
commentary?  Regardless of what people write, you keep trying to twist
things into what YOU want to hear.  People with similar tendencies in
more extreme form are sometimes called Historical Revisionists.  Is
this something that you aspire to?
