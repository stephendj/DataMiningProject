He had 211 IP, but didn't win the Cy Young.  Maddux surprised all.

I don't think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last
year, and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start.

Looks like it.  He wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an
ace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.

I honestly can't say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were
down last year.

I just don't think he's that good....

>12. Billy Ripken will *never* again hit over .240 with 400+ AB.

:-)  So far, so good.  I'm *definitely* not waiting to check this one.

Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief.  He has a
rubber arm and unusual delivery.  He might be decent in that role.

Wrong on all of the above.  (Hal Morris????)

Belle hit 34 HR last year, walking 52 times (but five of those were
intentional!).  Okay, so I exaggerate.  But I *might* have been right.

How much did Cal sign for?  When did he sign?  If I remember
correctly, he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season.

Snyder is still in SF.  Acker is gone??

They aren't in the majors.

Never heard of him.

I don't *think* they are in the majors.

Dunno what happened to him.

If he's still around, he's stuck in the minors.

Hm.  With Raines out, Bo looks to get a lot of PT.

Hm.
